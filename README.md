# 463_Java_Test
For Software Testing class.

Each file will have the following:
-Header with team name...
-Unit under test, with Prereq., Data req., Equip. req.
-Test cases.

Each Test Case will have:
- #
- Name (ex: Command(Integer, String) constructor test - Normal conditions )
- Description - outlines the intent of the test
- Expected result - instance, exception, updated values...

For now, there is a copy/pasted example at the top of each file,
and the original java code below for quick reference.

Our job is to write the comment headers for as many valid tests as we can.
So, look at the slides for test ideas - normal conditions, edge cases...

Before working on anything, perform a "git pull", then make changes,
and push your changes to the remote repository with:
$ git add *
$ git commit -m "I changed ... files, wrote tests..."
$ git push origin master

Try to get started this weekend, and we can talk monday...
